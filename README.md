Rise! for Android
=================

What is it?
-
*Rise! for Android* is a **100% unoffical** Android port of the game *Rise!*, an abstract strategy game created by [Crash Games](http://crashgamesaz.com) in 2011.

*Rise! for Android* is a pet project of mine, and was created with purpose of teaching myself about Android game development, as well as having the ability to play _Rise!_ with my friends when not in physical proximity with them. 

__*There is no intention for this game to ever be released, and no copyright infringment is intended. This is purely a labour of love.*__
